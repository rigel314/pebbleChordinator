Chordinator
===========
Displays guitar chord finger positions.

Now shows chords for __ukulele__ and __piano__ too!

This data in this app was found by searching Google for chords.  The chords may be entirely wrong.  If you find an error, create an issue or send me a pull request.

Inversions may have been used. (Usually to make chords fit on the Pebble's screen.)
